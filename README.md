# My English book work for 10th grade

---

### The purpose of the project is creating a social media page about a character from the book "Wonder". The person I choose is definetly August "Auggie" Pullman since he is the main protagonist of the book. I hope you enjoy it.

> Legal disclaimer (I guess): This website doesn't have any financial purpose. This website is all about an English project. I hope it has nothing to violate the intellectual property of either the book "Wonder" or Instagram.
